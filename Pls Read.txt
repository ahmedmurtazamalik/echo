What I did (or tried to)

0. Added 5 venues in the venue table

1. Made a getVenues function in SQLHandler that returns all the entries of Venue table

2. In SocietyController, added the venue objects in eventVenueComboBox (all the observable list stuff)
Full objects of Venue showing up rn, couldn't figure out how to set the combobox display as venue name only

3. Made a createEvent function in SQLHandler that uses the CreateEvent stored procedure from echoDBProcs
(Issue is in here according to my estimation, something to do with society id being used in the stored procedure instead of account id)

4. In the organizeEvent function in SocietyController, gathered all the entered data and used the createEvent function which I made in SQLHandler
Sent alert for invalid input
